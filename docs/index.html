    	<div class="overview">
        	The Cleaning House mobile application is an essential tool that allows property owners to connect with people willing to clean their properties. There are two types of accounts that can use the application, Hosts and Cleaners. Hosts can add their properties along with some information on the house, and a respective wage to clean it. Once a host has posted a property, it can be seen and selected by a cleaner and then the cleaner can reach out to the host if they are interested in cleaning that property.        </div>

            <h1>Choosing a Role</h1>
                <p>When you first use the Cleaning House mobile application, you will be asked to choose a role. The available roles are Cleaners and Hosts. Cleaners are people who wish to earn money by cleaning properties posted on the application. Hosts are property owners who are willing to pay a Cleaner to clean one or more of their properties. Once you have chosen your role, the application will remember your choice in the future. </p>
