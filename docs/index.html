        	The Cleaning House mobile application is an essential tool that allows property owners to connect with people willing to clean their properties. There are two types of accounts that can use the application, Hosts and Cleaners. Hosts can add their properties along with some information on the house, and a respective wage to clean it. Once a host has posted a property, it can be seen and selected by a cleaner and then the cleaner can reach out to the host if they are interested in cleaning that property.        </div>

            <h1>Choosing a Role</h1>
                <p>When you first use the Cleaning House mobile application, you will be asked to choose a role. The available roles are Cleaner and Host. Cleaners are people who wish to earn money by cleaning properties posted on the application. Hosts are property owners who are willing to pay a Cleaner to clean one or more of their properties. Once you have chosen your role, the application will remember your choice in the future. </p>

            <h1>Managing Properties (Host)</h1>
            <p>As a Host, you will be able to add, view, and remove properties that you have posted. By navigating to the Host's Homescreen, a Host can view all of their properties by clicking the "Properties" button. From the properties screen, the Host can add more properties to the list by pressing the "Add Property" button. Then the Host can enter the property's information and add it to the current listings available to cleaners.  </p>
            
                                    <br />

                        
            <h1>Browsing Properties (Cleaner)</h1>
            <p>As a cleaner, you will be able to browse the various properties that have been posted by Hosts and can view the wage, square footage, and address of each property. A Cleaner can view listed properties by navigating to the Cleaner's homescreen. From there the Cleaner can press the "Current Listings" button. A Cleaner can scroll throught the listed properties and select one they wish to clean.   </p>
