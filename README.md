## CleaningHouseApp
This is a repo based on building an app, that utilizes firebase and android studio. This app will be a cleaning app, where users can be either cleaner or a host: cleaners can pick up jobs, hosts can post properties that need to be cleaned. This app will entail users having profiles, being able to post listings or properties, message other users, and process payments.  
Views of the app can be seen here at [Sign-In](https://github.com/SCCapstone/CleaningHouse/wiki/Signing-In), [Main Screens](https://github.com/SCCapstone/CleaningHouse/wiki/Main-Screens-and-Side-Bars), and [Architecture Views](https://github.com/SCCapstone/CleaningHouse/wiki/Architecture:-Views).
